# Crafting Resume Bullets

The primary purpose of your resume is to demonstrate to a recruiter that you possess specific skills. Recruiters spend only a few seconds glancing over your resume so you have to rely on keywords to tell the story.

## Steps to take

1. Identify a key skill that you will demonstrate.
2. Answer the following for each bullet:
- What did I do?
- How does it demonstrate the key skill?
- What was the impact or benefit?
- 

**Steps to take:** A. Identify a key skill or technology you want to demonstrate knowledge in.

B. Pick a feature from one of your projects that either was enabled by said technology or let you use the skill you want to demonstrate.

C. Use the skill and feature in a bullet point that tells us how you implemented said feature using said skill/technology. Your goal is to demonstrate that you understand how that skill/technology actually works from an engineering standpoint.

## Examples:

> Eric note: The point is, list bullets as direct actions and results . i.e. "Implemented...", "Created an eBook that led to signing 3 new clients for the company."

**Skill: APIs** Feature: Global on-off switch

Designed global on-off switch & dimmer React-Native components by making HTTP post requests to the Phillips Hue API changing the state of the bulbs in turn.

**Skill: UI/UX Design** Feature: Drag and drop canvas for lightbulbs

Developed a smooth, intuitive UI with high usability by leveraging the React-Native PanResponder Library to allow users to map bulbs to their physical space in their room

**Skill: JS Promises & Async Functions**  Feature: Saving user preferences

Implemented scenes feature to allow users to save their current settings by utilizing React-Native’s AsyncStorage library & JavaScript promises to fetch & store data asynchronously

Compile a list of the skills you want to demonstrate, then craft your bullets around them.

### Example 1 (Non technical)

**Skill to Demonstrate**: Leadership

**What did I do?**: Founded company softball team

**How does it demonstrate the key skill?**: Took initiative. Organized long-term project.

**What was the impact or benefit?**: Improved team morale and collaboration.

**Result**: “Founded and managed company softball team, resulting in improved morale and communication.”

**Software related skills** * Anything you coded. Even if it was brief or unfinished or unofficial * Quantitative analysis / handling data * Improvements to a website

**Recognition** * Published something * Gave a talk * Won an award * Given a new responsibility or job title

**Interpersonal skills** * Were part of a team * Handled heavy volume of customer… * Mentored someone * Made clients happy * Made coworkers happy * Attracted customers * Negotiated something

**Output** * Made something faster or better * Reduced number of errors * Took initiative to do something * Delivered project on time

**Money** * Made or saved money * Handled lots of money (or widgets worth a lot of money) * Delivered project within budget

## Example 2 (Technical)

### TECHNICAL SKILLS IMPORTANT NOTE: When writing, try not to discuss a feature, but try to let the reader know about the feature and what YOU did to make it happen!

**Skill to Demonstrate**: Scaling an App

**What did I do?**: Stored images in the cloud.

**How does it demonstrate the key skill?**: Shows I know how to use AWS S3.

**What was the impact or benefit?**: Reduces server load and allows for scale.

**Result**: “Stores image uploads in the cloud using AWS S3, reducing server load and allowing app to scale gracefully.”

## Example 3 (Technical)

**Skill to Demonstrate**: Use of Third-Party API.

**What did I do?**: Determine user locations and filter searches.

**How does it demonstrate the key skill?**: Shows I know how to use the Google Maps API.

**What was the impact or benefit?**: Allows users to search for each other based on location

**Result**: “Integrates Google Maps API with geolocation based searching to display location of other users on a map.”

## Notes from a Technical Coach:

Bullet points should be substantive. A good pattern to follow is the following:

**GOOD:**  **“Used [technology] to implement [feature/idea/functionality] allowing for [very brief description of the capabilities]”**

Example: “Utilized AWS S3 and the Paperclip gem to implement user image uploads reducing server load and allowing for scalability of image services.”

We do not want to you use overly simple, un-substantive, or all jargon bullet points. We also do not want to simply describe what our apps do:

**BAD:**

“Implemented CRUD functionality for note taking.”

“Persisted user data with AJAX requests to the Rails backend”

“Leveraged ActiveRecord in Rails to make queries to the PostgreSQL database and generate JSON views with the jBuilder gem.”

> Also, do not want to talk about the amount of time it took to build apps or their features. It does not read as impressive when you say “Implemented music sharing functionality in 2 weeks.” If you want to highlight an impressive time constraint (say, 48 hours for a fullstack app at a hackathon) Include the name of the event/the amount of time you took to build it in parenthesis in the description of the app before the bullet points, BUT DO THIS SPARINGLY.

When answering these questions, the key is to point out features you built that went **above and beyond the basic requirements**.

### Example bullet points:

- Integrated Google Maps API with the Ruby Geocoder gem and custom search functionality to dynamically present business locations based on user parameters.
- Utilized Redux architecture’s unidirectional data flow with React for predictable state and reliablle DOM rendering
- Used observer pattern to handle management of global Z-indexes for overlapping items.
- Lowered latency of DB read/write by factor of 7 by using Unicorn to enable virtual multi-threaded processing.
- Used xcode in conjunction with React Native library to hook into mobile device cameras and geolocation.
- Designed dynamic data-visualizations with Javascript implemented algorithms based on user input
- Created custom modal framework using React component architecture allowing for efficient development of new forms.
- Created top-level music player using HTML5 audio and React, giving the user seamless audio streaming during navigation.
- Leveraged custom event listeners and the Redux cycle to dynamically sync audio waveforms and play-pause toggle buttons with music player.
- Utilized CSS media queries to create a fully responsive, device agnostic design.
- Configured the Node backend with PostgreSQL, using the Sequelize ORM for validations and database queries.
- Incorporated MVC architecture with Polymorphic model associations, reducing the number of required tables by almost 50%.
- Implemented local strategy for user authentication with Passport.js, using BCrypt for password hashing.
- Generated intelligent, movement-based animation using asynchronous Javascript.
- Developed collision detection algorithm for sprite characters, and integrated with keystroke event listeners to predict future player direction and movement.
- Utilized HTML Image Maps to allow users to click directly on an item in a photograph.
- Recorded user activity using React Router to create a seamless user experience during authentication process and app navigation.
- Processed and displayed reat-time BTC price data in the Sentiment Analysis by simultaneously leveraging Twitter Streaming API and CoinBase Digital Currency API
- Designed intuitive, device-agnostic UI using Adobe Xd to meet Progressive Web App (PWA) standards.
- Developed a custom responsive calendar using CSS3 to display logged infusions.
