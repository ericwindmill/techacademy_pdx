New Relic Team,

The two most important things to me at a job are a great team and a product that I am personally invested in making the best it can be. The craft of writing software can be motivating in itself, but it doesn’t compare to building something for an audience that I understand and care about. And that’s why I’ve always wanted to work for a company that makes products for developers.

At my current job, I have somewhat of a reputation as being an extreme, unrelenting advocate for the end user. The irony, though, is that I have no context for the end user, because I’m building a product that I will never use. This is why I want to work at New Relic. It’s a product for the people I understand the best: engineers. 

Here’s a few other reasons I want to work there, briefly: The job is full-stack with a front-end focus. That’s completely ideal for me. Right now I work about 70% on the front-end, and 30% on the server. Also, The job listing seems to indicate that theres opportunity to work in Rails, as well as on some mobile apps (Java and Kotlin are listed). I also find that ideal. In the last year I’ve been rewriting my companies mobile clients into a cross platform app, and it’s been a blast thinking about a new interface paradigm.

Both above accounts indicate that your teams and I have some important philosophies in common. I care deeply about products and users, and am completely technology agnostic. I just want to build things that I believe in, with a team I care about, using tools that are best for the job — whatever they may be. 

Lastly, (and this is an educated guess), it looks like there’s a lot of data visualization in your apps. Building data-viz based dashboards is one of my favorite types of UI to build.

Other than aligned interests, I can bring value to your company in a couple ways: First, I like what I do, so I work hard. You can count on me for that. Also, I believe software is a team sport. I’d be invested in being a productive part of the team. I’ll ask too many questions, and jump at the opportunity to pair or help someone out with a bug. Communication and collaboration are the most important aspects of a companies culture, in my opinion. Next, I’m hungry to get better. You’ll never find me offended at criticism. In fact, the more comments on code reviews, the better. I can’t get better if no one tells me what I can improve on. Lastly, as I mentioned, you can count on me to be an unwavering advocate for the end user. 

Anyways, I’d love to have an opportunity to talk about exactly what you’re looking for in filling this engineering position.

Best,
Eric Windmill
